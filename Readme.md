Interactive development Assingment 1

# Beatles Website

For Assignment 1, I set out to create a webpage for a band name 'Beatles' hoping to intorduce the icon of the 60s
to visitor of the website for them to know the band better and to help the band with the auction of their merchandise.

## Design Process

This website is for the beatles band to help grow thier fanbase bigger and to help them auction off their merchandise. The best way my project helps the band is by having a page where it gives a general background of the band information and a page where user are able to view the band merchandise and contact them for more information.

As a user navigate throught the web, they want to know more about the band they can head to the link in the navigation bar named
'About' click on it and be brought to a page where more information is written.

Website wireframe:
Adobe XD: <iframe width="4184" height="1176" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/32a77cb1-c31c-41af-8b5c-f307c26c1109-67f4/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Features

index.html or aka 'Home' on the website the first thing user see when the visit the website thispage briefly introduces the members of the band.

About.html or aka 'About' on the website is for users to get to know the band better in hopes to help the band out by gaining a bigger fanbase.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
