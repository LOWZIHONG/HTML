Interactive development Assingment 1

# Beatles Website

For Assignment 1, I set out to create a simple webpage for a band name 'Beatles' hoping to intorduce the icon of the 60s
to visitor of the website for them to know the band better and to help the band with the auction of their merchandise.

## Design Process

This website is for the beatles band to help grow thier fanbase bigger and to help them auction off their merchandise. The best way my project helps the band is by having a page where it gives a general background of the band information and a page where user are able to view the band merchandise and contact them for more information.

As a user navigate throught the web, they want to know more about the band they can head to the link in the navigation bar named
'About' click on it and be brought to a page where more information is written.

Website wireframe:
Adobe XD: <iframe width="4184" height="1176" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/32a77cb1-c31c-41af-8b5c-f307c26c1109-67f4/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Features

index.html or aka 'Home' on the website the first thing user see when the visit the website thispage briefly introduces the members of the band.

About.html or aka 'About' on the website is for users to get to know the band better in hopes to help the band out by gaining a bigger fanbase.

Product.htmls or aka 'Products' on the website is to help users who are intrested in purchasing the band merchandise in that page there is a 'contact for more info' link where it will bring user to a form page for them to fill out.

In the mobile view there is a hamburger menu that helps user navigate throughout the website easily.

### Existing Features

Feature 1 - allows users to achieve contacting the band for more information, by having them fill out a simepl form.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea:
  While coding up the web i had many ideas on how i can make more intresting micro interactions for users and thougth of a carousel slide so that user can scroll back and forth between contents throught the page.

## Technologies Used

Adobe XD

- The project uses Adobe XD to create a wireframe design of the website. (Refer to Design process above for Adobe XD link to wireframe)

Visual Studio Code
Use to create/code the website for this assingments, for this assigment i used HTML as the priamry programming language, cascading stylesheet for the layout and design of the web. Last but not least a simple javascripts was used.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form

- User browse through the web and views the band merchandie.
- User wishes to know more about the product and clicks the 'contact for more info' found on the page.
- User is redirected to a form page where he/she fills up a simple form that get basic information like name and email and a message box.
- User forgets to key the email, gets prompted by the input validation i coded into the form page. Where by it is required to give the user name & their email in order to submit their response.

  2.Cross browser

- At the start i faced issue with cross browser compatibility when my external css doesnt load to chrome but i have since rectify it and my project is able to run on IE,Chrome and firfox the main three browser i used to test my website responsivesness.

3. Mobile view

- In terms of responsiveness the website is fully responsive, while some of the pages i struggle with getting the content to conform to the mobile view i still manage to make it easier for user to view.
